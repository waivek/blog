How do people get new ideas?
============================

Presumably, the process[Something](https://something.com) of creativity, whatever it is, is essentially
the same in all its branches and varieties, so that the evolution of a
new art form, a new gadget, a new scientific principle, all involve
common factors ^[[Google](https://google.com)] . We are most interested in the
“creation” of a new scientific principle or a new application of an old
one, but we can be general here.
